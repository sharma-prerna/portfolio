      <description>The project aimed to develop an accurate model for accurately classifying images into emotion categories. This report outlines the approach taken, the dataset used, the methodology employed, and the results obtained.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project consisted of images categorized into multiple classes. Upon analysis, it was observed that the dataset was imbalanced, with some classes having significantly fewer samples than others. To address this issue, data augmentation techniques were applied to generate additional images for the underrepresented classes.</description>
