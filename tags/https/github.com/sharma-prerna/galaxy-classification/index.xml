      <description>In astronomy, the study of galaxies is an important field that helps us understand the evolution of the universe. Classifying galaxies into different types, such as elliptical, spiral, and irregular, is a key task in this field. However, manually classifying galaxies is a time-consuming and challenging task, which is why machine learning models have been developed to automate the process.
This project involves developing a machine learning model that accurately classifies galaxies into different types.</description>
