      <description>The Image Captioning Generator is a project I worked on that involves the development of a neural network model capable of generating captions for input images. This project was particularly interesting to me because it required a combination of two different problems: language modeling and image classification.
To tackle this challenge, I used two different neural network architectures: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The CNN was used for image classification, while the LSTM was used for language modeling.</description>
